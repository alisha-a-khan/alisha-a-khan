## Education
Pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a Master's in Data Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology, I've been immersed in learning the intricacies of computational techniques and data strategies.

## Professional Experience
- **Software and Machine Learning Enginner:** I am designing user interfaces in Figma and developing an iOS mobile application using Flutter (Dart). Concurrently, I'm building the app's backend in Python, focusing on implementing a machine learning-based recommender system. Additionally, I am integrating the OpenAI Python library to leverage generative AI, streamlining user decisions regarding event dates, costs, and venue selections.

- **Data Scientist Intern at MongoDB:** At MongoDB, I advocated for and influenced the modification of a machine learning model's scope. This experience provided me an opportunity to understand and contribute significantly to the data strategy.

- **Data Scientist Intern at Meta:** My role involved analyzing data to identify monetization opportunities. This involved closely working with different teams and presenting findings that influenced key decisions.

- **Computer Science Teaching Assistant at Illinois Tech:** I mentored students twice weekly on a financial literacy software project using M1 Finance. We developed a Python program that offers insights into loan payment plans, covering UI design, data structures, algorithms, and debugging.
  
- **Data Scientist Intern at Exelon Utilities:** I worked on a project that forecasted power plant failures, potentially saving significant resources. This involved data extraction, preprocessing, and utilizing Python for analytical tasks.

- **Data Science Researcher at Illinois Tech:** I identified racial biases in Illinois Techâ€™s undergraduate admissions using R statistical analysis and delivered a research paper suggesting solutions to improve equitability by 10%.

## Featured Projects
- **Graph Neural Network-Based Room Type Prediction:** This project was an endeavor into neural networks where I used PyTorch to predict room types. It demonstrated the power of neural networks in real-world scenarios.

- **COVID-19 Tweet Classifications:** An important project where I developed a natural language processing pipeline to classify tweets related to COVID-19.

- **Co-founder and Co-president of WiSTEM:** This initiative aimed to amplify women's voices in STEM fields. Our team managed to secure significant sponsorships and created impact on campus.

## Technical Skills
My toolkit includes a range of languages and libraries, such as `Python`, `R`, `SQL`, `Java`, `Dart`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `PyTorch`, `OpenCV`, and more.
